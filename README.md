Otto Setup
-----------------
Works both Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows.

1. Install otto [Download here](https://ottoproject.io/downloads.html)
2. run `otto compile && otto dev`
3. run `otto dev ssh` to ssh into development environment
4. start at step 3 for Ubuntu setup, with the working directory is `/vagrant/`

Ubuntu Installation
-------------------
Assuming you are in Ubuntu terminal:

1. Install MongoDB. Reference: [How to install MongoDB on Ubuntu](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)
   * Configure apt package tool: `sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 7F0CEB10`
   * Create a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/10gen.list file using the following command:
     `echo 'deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/10gen.list`
   * Now issue the following command to reload your repository:
     `sudo apt-get update`
   * Issue the following command to install the latest stable version of MongoDB:
   	 `sudo apt-get install mongodb-10gen`
   * Start Mongod DB service:
     `sudo service mongodb start`
   * Test that Mongo is running:
   	 `mongo`
   	 You should see something like: `MongoDB shell version: x.x.x. connecting to: test >`

2. Now that MongoDB is running, we need to install Node.js:
   `sudo apt-get install python-software-properties`
   `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js`
   `sudo apt-get update`
   `sudo apt-get install nodejs`

3. Navigate to your local Tidepools-Mobile directory (`cd /Tidepools-Mobile/` etc):
	* Start the Tidepools Mobile Node server:
	  `node tidepools_server.js`
	* IF there's an ERROR saying something like "Cannot find module 'example_module'", then you need to install additional modules using the Node NPM Package system:
	  `npm install example_module` - Replace "example_module" with the module listed in the error.
	  `node tidepools_server.js` - If more modules errors persist, install those as well.
	* IF the server is running, it should say: "Chillin' on 3002 ~ ~" -- "3002" being the port number Tidepools is running on.
	* Test it! Open a web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3002/`
      Note: This localhost address might vary, depending on your Linux version.
    * If you want to Tidepools to run after you close terminal, use Forever:
      `npm install forever`
      Start: `forever start tidepools_server.js`
      Check node servers running: `forever list`
      Stop: `forever stop tidepools_server.js`

4. Adding a custom map:
	* Your Tidepools base map settings are located in: app/js/angular-leaflet-directive.js
	* By default, Tidepools is using cloud-based map tiles. Change the map URL, by modifying the `tilelayer` field
	* To use local, custom tiles, comment out the first `var defaults = {}` and uncomment the second `var defaults = {}`
	  This is now using local map tiles in the 1.0.0 folder. A conference map is included as an example.
	  To build your own custom tiles to add to the 1.0.0 folder, see: http://wiki.tidepools.co/view/Map_Tiles
	* In `global_settings.js`, change the `global_mapCenter` to your map's lat lng center

5. Adding new Places and Events:
	* Navigate to "http://localhost:3002/new" (or wherever your localhost server is accessible)
	  Input form data. The "hashtag" section will auto-pull Tweets into your place or event, if the Tidepools Twitter Stream Server is running.
	* Edit places and events: "http://localhost:3002/#/landmark/UniqueID/edit" - "UniqueID" being the name of your place or event
	* You can automate the adding process, by plugging in JSON directly (See the 'Session_Event_API_loader' directory for more info).

6. Running Twitter Stream Server to integrate #hashtagged data into your Tidepools events and places:
	* Navigate to the "Streaming Tweet Loader" directory.
	* Get your Twitter access tokens: https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/obtaining-access-tokens
	* Edit the `credentials_example.js` file, adding in your unique Twitter tokens.
	* Change the filename to `credentials.js`
	* Edit `global_settings.js` in `../app/js` : Change the `global_hashtag` to your neighborhood or event's main Twitter hashtag (i.e. #Event2013)
	* Start streaming:
	  `node tweet_server.js`
	* Make it stream forever:
	  `forever start tweet_server.js`


OSX Installation
-------------------
Assuming you are in OSX terminal:

1. Install MongoDB. Reference: [How to install MongoDB on OSX](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
	* Install Homebrew if you haven't already (package manager): http://brew.sh/
	* Install Mongo via Homebrew:
	  `brew update`
	  `brew install mongodb`
	* Start the mongod process in a terminal:
	  `mongod` to start MongoDB service
	  `mongo` to test:
	  You should see something like `MongoDB shell version: x.x.x. connecting to: test >`

2. Install Node.js
	* Assuming you have installed Homebrew from the previous step:
	  `brew install node`

3. Navigate to your local Tidepools-Mobile directory (`cd /Tidepools-Mobile/` etc):
	* Start the Tidepools Mobile Node server:
	  `node tidepools_server.js`
	* IF there's an ERROR saying something like "Cannot find module 'example_module'", then you need to install additional modules using the Node NPM Package system:
	  `npm install example_module` - Replace "example_module" with the module listed in the error.
	  `node tidepools_server.js` - If more modules errors persist, install those as well.
	* IF the server is running, it should say: "Chillin' on 3002 ~ ~" -- "3002" being the port number Tidepools is running on.
	* Test it! Open a web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3002/`
      Note: This localhost address might vary, depending on your Linux version.
    * If you want to Tidepools to run after you close terminal, use Forever:
      `npm install forever`
      Start: `forever start tidepools_server.js`
      Check node servers running: `forever list`
      Stop: `forever stop tidepools_server.js`
